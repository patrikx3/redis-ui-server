# Description  

                        
[//]: #@corifeus-header:end


This is part of a composable  `p3x-redis-ui` package. This is the server based on Socket.IO (no rest at all).  
The server will be using the `p3x-redis-ui-material` web client package based on built with Webpack, Socket.IO and AngularJs Material.  
This package is named as `p3x-redis-ui-server`.


## Configuration

For now, there are 2 configuration files:
```bash
p3xrs --config ./p3xrs.json
```

The 2nd configuration is the list of the connections if found in `p3xrs.json` it either in the config: 
```text
p3xrs.json/p3xrs.connections['home-dir'] = undefined|home|absolute|relative 
```

The best is to keep it undefined and it will be in your home dir, but you can choose any place as well.

You may also set connections file name which overrides default .p3xrs-conns.json
```text
p3xrs --connections-file-name .p3xrs-conns.json
```


# For development standalone

For file names do not use camelCase, but use kebab-case. Folder should be named as kebab-case as well. As you can see, all code filenames are using it like that, please do not change that.
Please apply the `.editorconfig` settings in your IDE.
  
Copy from `./artifacts/boot/p3xrs.json` to the root folder (`./p3xrs.json`).


```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

It uses `nodemon` and when any file is changed, it will re-load it.

The server app is available @    
http://localhost:7843

üôè This is an open-source project. Star this repository, if you like it, or even donate to maintain the servers and the development. Thank you so much!

Possible, this server, rarely, is down, please, hang on for 15-30 minutes and the server will be back up.

All my domains ([patrikx3.com](https://patrikx3.com) and [corifeus.com](https://corifeus.com)) could have minor errors, since I am developing in my free time. However, it is usually stable.
    
**Note about versioning:** Versions are cut in Major.Minor.Patch schema. Major is always the current year. Minor is either 4 (January - June) or 10 (July - December). Patch is incremental by every build. If there is a breaking change, it should be noted in the readme.
